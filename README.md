To run, first you have to build the client with vite, then serve the build from the server. To do this:

First, make sure that all the dependencies are installed.

1. Go to client folder,then run 'npm run build'
2. Go to server folder, then run 'node src/server.js'

If you are getting error messages, this is often due to the dependencies not installed on your local machine and your native environment.
Please contact me if you want to see it ran on my computer.
